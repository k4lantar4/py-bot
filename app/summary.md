# Summary of Issues and Recommendations

## Issues Identified

1. **Dependency Conflicts**: The `requirements.txt` file had several dependency conflicts:
   - `django-otp` version conflict
   - `pydantic` version conflict with `zarinpal`
   - `urllib3` version conflict with `requests` and `django-anymail`

2. **Project Structure Issues**: The project has a complex structure with nested Django projects:
   - The main Django project is in the `backend` directory
   - There's another Django project in the `backend/backend` directory
   - The `manage.py` file is looking for a `config` module, but it's not in the correct location

3. **Port Conflicts**: There were port conflicts with PostgreSQL:
   - Port 5432 is already in use on the host machine

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Dependency Conflicts**:
   - Use compatible versions of packages in `requirements.txt`
   - Consider using a virtual environment for development
   - Use Docker for isolation in production

2. **Fix Project Structure**:
   - Simplify the project structure
   - Ensure that the `config` module is in the correct location
   - Update the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable

3. **Fix Port Conflicts**:
   - Use different ports for services in Docker Compose
   - Check for running services on the host machine

4. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Create a simple test project to verify the setup
   - Test each component separately
   - Use Docker Compose for integration testing

## Next Steps

1. Simplify the project structure
2. Fix the dependency conflicts
3. Update the Docker Compose configuration
4. Test each component separately
5. Integrate the components
